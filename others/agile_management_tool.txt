Topic: Agile Management Tool
Description: Our semester project will be a backend app for an Agile team. This software will serve as a solution for managing tasks and tracking progress.
The core functionality of this software includes:
1.	Task Hierarchy Management (WBS): This feature will allow the team to structure their tasks in a hierarchical manner, facilitating better organization and tracking.
2.	Backlog Management: The software will maintain a backlog, which is essentially a list of tasks that are ready for implementation. Each task will be estimated using story points.
3.	Task Estimation Using Story Points: This feature will enable the team to estimate the effort required for each task using story points, promoting efficient resource allocation.
4.	Sprint Planning and Tracking: The software will also handle sprints, assisting the team in planning their work for each sprint and tracking their progress.
5.	Task State Management: The system will manage various task states such as READY, IN PROGRESS, and DONE, and support state changes.
6.	Time Tracking: This feature will allow team members to log the time they spend on each task, aiding in future task estimations and workload management.
7.	User Management: The system will also handle user management, assigning different roles and permissions to team members based on their responsibilities within the team.
This backend system is primarily targeted at developers and Agile teams who are seeking a solution to manage their tasks, sprints, and overall progress. We believe that our software will significantly enhance productivity and efficiency within Agile teams.
